        Dear User,
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 1px; margin-left: 20">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We both are students at "Babe&#351; Bolyai University" studying something
        related to IT. What you can see on this website was made by us, with the help of some very kind people from
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freshbyte.ro/">Freshbyte</a>. We were lucky enough to be given the opportunity to participate in an internship here and learn how to
        make something like this in a couple of weeks. I am aware that this is not very much or very flashy, but
        please consider that, for example, I've never done anything like this before. My colleague had a little
        more knowledge in this area than me, but his also, restrained to some information gathered in high school.
    <p style="margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 1px; margin-left: 20">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certainly hoping that one day we could look
        back at this web page and smile, having already made many more, much more interesting
        and beautiful sites, but never forgetting where our roots are, where our start was.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 1px; margin-left: 20">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I had the honor to write anything I want on this page, I'd like to finish
        by thanking <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freshbyte.ro/">Freshbyte</a> for the opportunity, my colleague for helping me whenever I was in need and last
        but not least, to our coordinators, Mircea Fernea and Cristian Buda for debugging our code and also,
        our minds when necessary.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-left: 20">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how to finish this, so I'll wish You something everybody needs.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 1px; margin-left: 700">
        Best of luck,
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 1px; margin-left: 740">
        T&#243;th Tam&#225;s
    </p>
